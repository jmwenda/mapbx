========================
The application provides a mechanism through which one can enter a starting point and and endpoint background then a traffic and a driving route are plotted. The traffic route is in blue while the plotted driving route is in green.

The application uses the starting location of the browser. If this is not provided the default is utilized.
The geocoder is also helpful for searching locations for routing.

To select a route, one has to doubleclick the traffic route. Once doubleclicked, an animation occurs and at the end of the trop the transparent popup indicates that the person has arrived. The driving router event has not been activated due to lack of time. I selected the doubleclick as opposed to the click as the click event is used in changing the route direction. So not possible due to a conflict in functions. 

The tilequery API has is only trigged approximately at the halfway point. This is due to lack of time.
